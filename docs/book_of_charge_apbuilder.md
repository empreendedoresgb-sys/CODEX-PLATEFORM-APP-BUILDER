# APBUILDER.APP — Book of Charge (Autonomous Build Protocol)

## Product principle
One sentence should generate one complete, high-quality functional app with minimal manual intervention.

## Mandatory build sequence
1. Requirement parsing
2. Architecture planning
3. Generation
4. Validation
5. Deployment preview
6. Release

No direct generation is allowed without planning and validation.

## Capability checklist
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Automated UI/backend/data generation
- Security and quality validation gates
- Preview URL generation
- Registry-driven language support
- API-first architecture

## Manual intervention policy
Manual actions only for unavoidable governance operations:
- production deployment approval
- legal acceptance
- billing activation
